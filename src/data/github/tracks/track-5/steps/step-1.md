Login is done. Now, let's make the user list UI.

# Step 1 - Create List Users

This screen will list all registered users. Each cell should contain:
  - username
  - user role

You can use your imagination to create a beautiful list! Just try to follow the same visual guide you used to create `login screen`.

**Tip**: For this task, you don't need to consume any service. For now, you can just mock the users and the real data will come in next task  😉.
