# Step 4/6 - Create a Pull Request

- Open a Pull Request of your `feature/setup` branch

If you don't remember how to open a Pull Request, check out the references in the previous issues. Your PR should have `develop` branch as base, to be merged into later.

This pull request will be reviewed by your Taqtile tutor and possibly by some other people. This process is called **Code Review (CR)**. You can ask your tutor who will be revising your code.

Mark them on every Pull Request as reviewers. Check [here](https://github.com/indigotech/taq-github-bot/pull/64) an example of Code Review. You'll possibly have some changes requested/suggested in order to merge your new branch on `develop`. Make sure to resolve all those changes **before** merging your branch into develop. ðŸ˜‰
