# Step 2/6 - Create a simple Hello World
#### Estimated time: 3 hours

Follow a tutorial project to create a minimal "Hello World" application using the technology stack you were assigned. If you don't know on which tech stack you are, please ask your tutor before continuing. We use **react** for web projects and **react-native** for mobile apps, both using **Typescript**. 
Below there are instructions for creating an simple Hello World in the tech stack you were assigned. So pick up yours and read it carefully:

## React

+ They have [this awesome tutorial](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript) to start developing
+ You only have to run `npx create-react-app . --template typescript` on terminal (your old README.md may be changed to README.md.old, just remove the new one and rename the old back to README.md)
+ After running the command above, clean up some code to show only a simple "Hello World"

## React-native

+ Start with [react-native setup tutorial](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) to make sure you have everything you need. Use the `React Native CLI Quickstart`, so you can be closer to how a Taqtile project works.
+ When the code setup is done, use the following command with typescript template: `npx react-native init YourProjectName --template react-native-template-typescript` (you may want to move your project files to the main folder (`mv -r ./YourProjectName . && rm -r ./YourProjectName`))
+ After running the command above, clean up some code to show only a simple "Hello World"
+ You can call it "done" after you're running it successfully on Android and iOS emulator (or device, if you prefer 🤓)

**Note:** For now on, some steps will have an **estimated time** to help you organizing your time better. 
If you do not finish the step in the estimated time **don't worry**! It's just an average time based on previous onboards. The main purpose of this estimated time is to indicate when you should ask for help in case you're stuck.

By the way, remember that if you're struggling with any topic, feel free asking any Taqtiler ;)
