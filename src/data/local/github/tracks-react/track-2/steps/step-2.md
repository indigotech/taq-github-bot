# Step 2/6 - Create a simple Hello World
#### Estimated time: 3 hours

Follow a tutorial project to create a minimal "Hello World" application using the technology stack you were assigned. If you don't know on which tech stack you are, please ask your tutor before continuing. We use **react** for web projects and **react-native** for mobile apps, both using **TypeScript**. 
Below there are instructions for creating an simple Hello World in the tech stack you were assigned. So pick up yours and read it carefully:

For both react and react-native, there are two options that you can use: with or without a framework. The initial documentation from react-native explores a little the differences of using and not using a framework. For you, using it or not depends on the project you're working after the onboard. So, in case you don't know if you should use a framework or not, ask your tutors.

<summary><h2>&nbsp;React</h2></summary>

+ Start with [react tutorial](https://react.dev/learn) and search for a "getting started" or "installation" to find a setup for your project
+ Regardless of the setup you use (with or without framework), make sure to use TypeScript. If the docs does not result in a TypeScript project by default, they should have instructions on how to add it.
+ After running the command above, clean up some code to show only a simple "Hello World"
+ You can call it "done" after you're running it successfully on the browser

<summary><h2>&nbsp;React Native</h2></summary>

+ Start with [react-native setup tutorial](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
+ Regardless of the setup you use (with or without framework), make sure to use Typescript. If the docs does not result in a Typescript project by default, they should have instructions on how to add it.
+ Clean up some code to show only a simple "Hello World"
+ You can call it "done" after you're running it successfully on Android and iOS emulator (or device, if you prefer ðŸ¤“)

**Note:** For now on, some steps will have an **estimated time** to help you organizing your time better. 
If you do not finish the step in the estimated time **don't worry**! It's just an average time based on previous onboards. The main purpose of this estimated time is to indicate when you should ask for help in case you're stuck. This is called **timebox**

By the way, remember that if you're struggling with any topic, feel free asking any Taqtiler ;)
