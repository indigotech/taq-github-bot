# Step 3/6 - Create a Pull Request

- Open a Pull Request of your `feature/setup` branch

If you don't remember how to open a Pull Request, check out the references in the previous issues. Your PR should have `develop` branch as base, to be merged into later.

This pull request will be reviewed by the Taqtile onboard team and possibly by some other people. This process is called **Code Review (CR)**. Assign for review the [group-onboard](https://github.com/orgs/indigotech/teams/group-onboard) github team, so everyone conducting the onboard will be notified.

Mark this group on every Pull Request as reviewers. Check [here](https://github.com/indigotech/taq-github-bot/pull/64) an example of Code Review. You'll possibly have some changes requested/suggested in order to merge your new branch on `develop`. Please make sure to discuss or resolve all those changes and await for at least 2 approvals **before** merging your branch into develop. ðŸ˜‰

**NOTE:** from now on, you can open a pull request after every step that has some coding.
