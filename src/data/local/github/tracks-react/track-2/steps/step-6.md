# Step 6/6 - Rebasing your branch

Here in Taqtile, before merging our revised (and approved) branches, we **rebase** this branch into the one we are attempting to merge. In this case, you'll rebase `docs/update-readme` or `feature/setup` to `develop`, depending on which one was reviewed and approved first.

Check out [this documentation](https://www.notion.so/taqtile/Git-flow-rebase-para-iniciantes-fed6d98c2fba4502a3067d9560234c9f?pvs=4) that explains some scenarios and how our git flow works.

Too confusing? Here are some good links you can read about **rebase**:

- [What is git rebase?](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-rebase)

**Note:** Remember that if you are stuck in any of these topics, feel free to ask any Taqtiler. We are here to help ðŸ˜‰

The ideal setup we are trying to achieve with the rebases are something like this:
