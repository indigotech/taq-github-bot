# Step 5/6 - Update README.md

### Estimated time: 20 minutes

Do you remember we created the `README.md` of this project before? Now that you have a project created on your technology stack, it's time to update it with some piece of information.

Since the `feature/setup` is (probably) still being reviewed, we need to create a new branch for this current step's task. Let's call this new branch `docs/update-readme`. Here's what you'll need to do:

- Go to develop branch: `git checkout develop`
- Open a new branch called `docs/update-readme`
- Update the `Environment and tools` section with some data about... well... your machine environment and the tools you're using. Things like the Node version, the Android Studio/Xcode version, the programming language any other relevant data for a developer to getting started in your project.
- The `Steps to run and debug` section is usually filled with information about how to run your project, such as what commands should the developer use or which configurations should he/she turn on/off before executing your project.

After that, open a pull request with these `README.md` changes.

**TIP:** an excellent README is that one document that is sufficient for any developer to be able to run and contribute to your project.
