# Step 5/5 - Rebasing your branch

Here in Taqtile, before merging our revised (and approved) branches, we **rebase** this branch into the one we are attempting to merge. In this case, you'll rebase `docs/readme` or `feature/setup` to `develop`, depending on which one was reviewed and approved first.

Too confusing? Here are some good links you can read about **rebase**:
- [Git Rebasing](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing)
- [What is git rebase?](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-rebase)
- Bonus: [Merging vs. Rebasing](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing)

**Note:** Remember that if you are stuck in any of these topics, feel free to ask any Taqtiler. We are here to help 😉

The ideal setup we are trying to achieve with the rebases are something like this:
