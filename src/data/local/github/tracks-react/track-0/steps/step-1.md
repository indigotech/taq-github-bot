# Taqtile - Onboard

Welcome to the Taqtile onboard. The main goals of this onboard are:

1. Learn the basics about some concepts by building your own application/website
2. Get you ready for a real project by presenting some of our tech stack and best practices

# Step 1/3 - Warming up - Mastering the Basics

Ok! Your very first tasks are to **clone this repository** into your own account and **update the README.md** file.

But before moving on, let's be sure you know all the basics we use daily here.

First, we use [git](https://git-scm.com/)... a lot. If you don't feel confident in your skills using git, here are some recommendations:

- https://try.github.io/
- https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials
- https://learngitbranching.js.org/

If you don't have it already, we recommend you to install the [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) VSCode extension. It's going to help you a lot with git by adding an extra view on activity bar (the icons on the left side).

![GitLens](https://github.com/indigotech/taq-github-bot/blob/master/images/gitlens.jpg)

It will help you to check the modified files, as well as the changes on each of them.

Even though this extension has some tools to perform git commands, we highly encourage you to use the terminal, and use the extension as a visual guide to your changes.

At the end of every task of this onboard, comment the word `Finish` on the issue to receive your next task (you can try reloading the page if it's taking too long).
You can also comment the word `next`, in case you had to skip the current task.

If you face any problem with the onboard, you can ask your tutor for help.
