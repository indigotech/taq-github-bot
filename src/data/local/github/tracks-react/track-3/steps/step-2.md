# Step 2/2 - Login validations
#### Estimated time: 2 hours

**(Re-Re-)Note:** Don't forget to open a new branch!

When filling up a form, users (us) can mispell something or forget to fill all the inputs in a form. So in this step you'll create some form validations.

Your login screen should have the following validations:

- **Email input**:
  - Should have a valid email format: ###@###.com
  - Should not be empty (required field)

- **Password input**:
  - Should not be empty (required field)
  - Minimum of 7 characters
  - Should have at least one digit and one letter

All these validations should be triggered when the user taps the submit button, showing message errors accordingly.

Once you've done, open a PR.
