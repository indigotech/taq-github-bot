# Step 4/5: Navigation
#### Estimated time: 2 hours

Now we're working with a core part of our application: the navigation. After your login is successfull and your have stored the authentication token, it's time to navigate to the next page.
We have some libs that makes our work easier. You can use any lib you want, but here are the ones we use on our projects:

## React

+ [react-router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router)

## React native

+ [react-native-navigation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-navigation)

Follow the instructions to install and use it successfully. You can, for now, navigate to a blank page. It will be populated on your next track.
