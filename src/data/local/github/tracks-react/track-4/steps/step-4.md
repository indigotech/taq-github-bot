#### Estimated time: 2 hours

Now we're working with a core part of our application: the navigation. After your login is successfull and your have stored the authentication token, it's time to navigate to the next page.
We have some libs that makes our work easier. Check with your mentor what lib you should use, because it depends of the project you're going to work later.

Follow the instructions to install and use it successfully. Your next page will be a users list, keep that in mind to name the files and components properly ðŸ˜‰.
