# Step 3/3 - Set the default branch

Set the default branch of your repository to the `develop` branch.

The Github has a really [easy guide](https://docs.github.com/pt/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-branches-in-your-repository/changing-the-default-branch) for doing this. Thanks Github ❤️
