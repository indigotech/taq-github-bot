Ok, there are no more features to add to your project for now! Now, you'll just apply the concepts you've learned so far, as well as some practices we use here at Taqtile.

# Step 1/4 - Thinking about components
#### Estimated time: 10 minutes

We ❤️ apps. And a crucial part of making a good app is the User Experience, a.k.a UX. Also, you've learned about componentization and how it contributes to making a good and usable app. So, this step is just a mental exercise. Below, we have two images representing 2 of the screens you developed so far: `Login` and `Create User`:

Looking at these screens, you can extract some components that can be (re)used. They are relatively simple to componentize, but, as you can imagine, there's not only one way of doing it, especially when the design gets more complex. So, before coding them in a hurry, let's take some minutes to think:

1. What components can be extracted?
2. Why should we extract them?
3. What attributes will each of these components contain?

After you answer these questions, go to the next step to see our suggestions on how to componentize them. Then, you'll start coding these components.
