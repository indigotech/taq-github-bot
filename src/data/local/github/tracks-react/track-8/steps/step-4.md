# Step 4/4 - Turning theory into code
#### Estimated time: 8 hours

Now that you have the most important and powerful tool we use, let's turn our components from steps 1 and 2 into code!

To do that in a reasonable time, we will focus only on **Login** and **Add User**, as we did before. Your job is to create some components and use them in both UIs, so you can see all the thoughts from steps 1 and 2 in action.

Here are some specifications our "design team" is giving to help you build the components. You don't exactly need to follow all the detailed values if you don't want to. What's __extremely important__ is to __have__ those specs parameterized, as the values are not that important: we should design our code to change them easily if necessary.

### H1: 
+ __Text size:__ 24px
+ __Text weight:__ bold
+ __Color:__ black `#000000`
+ __Margins:__ 20px top, 20px bottom

### Button: 
+ __Text size:__ 16px
+ __Text weight:__ regular
+ __Background color:__ pick one üòâ
+ __Text color:__ black or white (whichever has better contrast with the background color)
+ __Height:__ 44px (it's important to have at least 44px so the user can click it comfortably)

You can add some things to these specs if you want, such as border radius, gradient, icons, etc. Just be careful with the time you're spending on this styling.

### Form
+ __Label on top:__
  + __Text size:__ 12px
  + __Text weight:__ regular
  + __Color:__ gray `#777777`
  + __Margins:__ 12px bottom
+ __Text field:__
  + __Border:__ 1px (can be full or only on bottom), color gray `#777777`
+ __Caption on bottom:__
  + __Text size:__ 12px
  + __Text weight:__ regular
  + __Color:__ red (pick one)
  + __Margins:__ 8px top

As for the behavior, your form should have two states:

+ __Normal:__ caption is hidden.
+ __Error:__ caption is shown and the 3 sub-components should be red. On the screens, this state will be triggered when the field is not filled or the condition is not satisfied (do you remember track 3, step 2? üòÅ).

**TIP:** Anytime you implement a component, it's a good practice to test it in isolation, so we can make sure it's working properly, including states/behaviors.
