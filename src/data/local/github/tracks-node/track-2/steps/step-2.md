# Step 2/5 - GraphQL setup
#### Estimated time: 3 hours

In this step you'll create a basic **hello-world GraphQL Node Server**. But before you start, there are some core concepts you need to know in order to understand what's going on on your code. Try to do some research on your own about these topics, but feel free to ask your tutor, or even another Taqtiler, for references, tips and/or clarifications:

1. Client-server architecture
1. HTTP communication
1. REST
1. GraphQL: shema (queries, mutations, types and inputs)

When you are confortable to follow, we suggest you take a look at the GraphQL [Getting Started](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/) guide to begin your quest.

To call this step done, you must have:

1. A simple GraphQL node server properly setup
1. A query called `hello` that returns a string, for example: `Hello, world!`
1. Make sure you tested your server running and performed the `hello` query. You should be able to access the Graphql docs and perform the query on: browser, [Graphiql](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) or [Graphql Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground) (you can choose the one you like). Keep this query for future testing!
