# Step 2/6 - GraphQL setup
#### Estimated time: 3 hours

In this step you'll have two main tasks: **create a node project with typescript** and **setup a graphql server**. But before you start, there are some core concepts you need to know in order to understand what's going on on your code. Try to do some research on your own about these topics, but feel free to ask your tutor, or even another Taqtiler, for references, tips and/or clarifications:

1. Client-server architecture
1. HTTP communication
1. REST
1. GraphQL

You can both setup these by yourself as showed in [this tutorial](https://www.howtographql.com/graphql-js/1-getting-started/) or use a cli to make this whole setup for you as [shown here](https://github.com/graphql-boilerplates/typescript-graphql-server/tree/master/basic) (we won't tell anyone 🤫). But remember: using this kind of setup doesn't mean you shouldn't know what's going on on that code.

After the setup, you should be able to access the Graphql docs, either on browser, [Graphiql](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) or [Graphql Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground) (you can choose the one you like) and successfully write some GraphQL queries/mutations. You can use the `Hello` query of the setups above to verify your server is working. Keep this query for future testing!

**Note:** For now on, some steps will have an **estimated time** to help you organizing your time better. 
If you do not finish the step in the estimated time **don't worry**! It's just an average time based on previous onboards. The main purpose of it is to indicate when you should ask for help in case you're stuck.

By the way, remember that if you're struggling with any topic, feel free to ask any Taqtiler ;)
