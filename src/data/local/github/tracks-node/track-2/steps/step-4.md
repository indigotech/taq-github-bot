# Step 4/4 - Create a Pull Request

- Open a Pull Request of your `feature/setup-graphql` branch

If you don't remember how to open a Pull Request, check out the references in the previous issues. Your PR should have `develop` branch as base, to be merged into later.

This pull request will be reviewed by your Taqtile tutor and possibly by some other people. This process is called **Code Review (CR)**. You can ask your tutor who will be revising your code.

Make sure you're marking them on every Pull Request as reviewers. Check [here](https://github.com/indigotech/br-qsaude-ecommerce-api/pull/119) for an example of Code Review. You'll possibly have some changes requested/suggested in order to merge this new branch on `develop`.

After opening the pull request, you can continue your work on a new branch.
