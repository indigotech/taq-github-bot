# Step 2/6 - Libraries everywhere: axios
### Estimated time: 2 hours

Another of those cool libraries is [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios). This library makes our work of performing requests to a server easier. Take a look at their docs.

Now, let's increment our step-by-step for the test execution:

1. Start the server
1. Run a single test

In order to acomplish this new first step, your task is to:

1. Install the library
2. Change your code to start the server `before(() => {})` beginning the test... (ðŸ¤£)
2. Use the `axios` library to communicate with the server you just started. You can use the `localhost:port` for this.
3. Try to perform your previously implemented `hello` query, from the `apllo-server` setup. For now, just check if it's working with `console.log`

**NOTE:** you can open a pull request after this step, so we can check if your setup is going ok for now.
