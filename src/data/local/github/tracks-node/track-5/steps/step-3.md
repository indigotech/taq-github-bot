# Step 3/6 - The last library (for now): chai
### Estimated time: 30 minutes

The last library for tests is [chai](https://www.chaijs.com/). Chai is a very complete library that handles assertion, i.e., checking if the result has the values that were expected to have. As usual, take a look at theis docs, install it on your project and try to use the `expect` function to compare the return of your `Hello` request with the expected value.

Try to use these functions as if you were writing a sentence, to improve readability. For example:

```typescript
expect(response).to.be.eq('Hello, Taqtiler!');
```
