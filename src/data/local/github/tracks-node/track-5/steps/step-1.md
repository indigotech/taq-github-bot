# Step 1/6 - First test setup
### Estimated time: 1 hour

Now you're going to work on another super-important concept on the process of building your own server. Have you ever stopped to think about how you would test if your code works? ðŸ¤”
If you thought about performing the request on one of those applications (Postman, CLI, etc...) and checking if it works as expected, that's one way of doing it. But we have a more solid proposal: writing more code for tests! The principle is simple: you give an input and check if the response is the expected. Why is it better? Well, some advantages:

1. The time gain: you write your test once, and then you can run it whenever you want, for as long as you want.
1. While you develop other features, you can keep running the tests for all the previous implemented queries/mutation to make sure they are still working.
1. Test codes can serve as a kind of documentation as well. People who read them are able to know all the particular scenarios of an endpoint.

If you search on the Internet, you'll find out there are many ways to test a code. Depending on the project, people decide to use one, or several of them. Here, we're going to write `integration tests`. For each route of your server, you're going to setup the database for them, provide some input scenarios, and then check if the response is given as expected and if the database sotres all data correctly. Take some minutes to read about them on the Internet.

Setting up tests on your server is not an easy task. There are a couple of things to learn and prepare first. We're going to create a step-by-step to help.

As you can imagine giving the previous steps, there are more cool libraries to help us on this process. We're going to present them one at a time.

The first one is the main library to write the tests codes: [mocha](https://mochajs.org/). Take a look at their docs. It's important to know that mocha provides some methods that can be executed like a timeline. This is very useful to handle tasks in specific orders.

Your task is very simple in this first step:

+ Install the library. You can use the `devDependencies` to install it. Would you be able to say why? ðŸ¤”
+ Create a test folder on the root of your project with an `index.ts` inside it.
+ Create a script on your `package.json` to run your tests with `npm run test`
+ Write a simple test with describe/it that just prints something. If it's running properly, go to next step.
