# Step 3/3 - Updating "get user" and "list users" requests
#### Estimated time: 2 hours

Now that we have the database properly setup with the addresses, we're going to update the two queries: "user" and "users". Now they should also return the addresses.

**NOTE:** don't forget to update your tests!

After that, open a PR! We could explore it more by creating a POST request to add an address to a user, and also update/remove an existing address. But we think this is enough as an intro for the **relation** concept.
