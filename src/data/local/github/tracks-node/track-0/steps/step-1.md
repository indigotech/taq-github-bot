# Taqtile - Onboard

Welcome to the Taqtile onboard. It will help you to get used to our technology stack, patterns and best practices.

Thoughout the onboard, you will develop a server able to:

1. Store some data in a database (db)
1. [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) that data stored in db

# Step 1/3 - Warming up - Mastering the Basics

Ok! Your first tasks will be given on next steps. But before moving on, let's be sure you know all the basics we use daily here.

We use [git](https://git-scm.com/)... a lot. If you don't feel confident in your skills using git, here are some recommendations:

- https://try.github.io/
- https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials
- https://learngitbranching.js.org/


If you don't have it already, we recommend you to install the [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) VSCode extension. It's going to help you a lot with git by adding an extra view on activity bar (the icons on the left side).

![GitLens](https://github.com/indigotech/taq-github-bot/blob/master/images/gitlens.jpg)

It will help you to check the modified files, as well as the changes on each of them.

Even though this extension has some tools to perform git commands, we highly encourage you to use the terminal, and use the extension as a visual guide to your changes.

On the end of every task of this onboard, comment the word `Finish` on the issue to receive your next task (you can try reloading the page if it's taking too long).
You can also comment the word `next`, in case you had to skip the current task.

In case of any issue, you can ask your tutor for help. Go to next step!
