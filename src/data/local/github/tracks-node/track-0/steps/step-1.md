# Taqtile - Onboard

Welcome to the Taqtile onboard. It will help you to get used to our technology stack, patterns and best practices.

Thoughout the onboard, you will develop a server able to:

1. Store some data in a database (db)
1. [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) that data stored in db

# Step 1/3 - Warming up - Mastering the Basics

Ok! Your first tasks will be given on next steps. But before moving on, let's be sure you know all the basics we use daily here.

We use [git](https://git-scm.com/)... a lot. If you don't feel confident in your skills using git, here are some recommendations:

- https://try.github.io/
- https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials
- https://learngitbranching.js.org/

BTW, we highly encourage training using the terminal.

On the end of every task of this onboard, comment the word `Finish` on the issue to receive your next task (you can try reloading the page if it's taking too long).
You can also comment the word `next`, in case you had to skip the current task.

Incase of any issue, you can ask your tutor for help. Go to next step!
