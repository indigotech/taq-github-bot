# Step 4/4 - Rebasing your branch

Here in Taqtile, before merging our revised (and approved) branches, we **rebase** it into the one we are attempting to merge. In this case, you'll rebase `feature/setup-graphql` to `develop`.

Too confusing? Here are some good links you can read about **rebase**:
- [Git Rebasing](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing)
- [What is git rebase?](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-rebase)
- Bonus: [Merging vs. Rebasing](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing)

**Note:** after your `feature/setup-database` is approved, you'll repeat this process.

The ideal setup we are trying to achieve with the rebases are something like below.:
