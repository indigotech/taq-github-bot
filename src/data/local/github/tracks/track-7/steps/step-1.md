Once you've finished the list, your next task is to create a **user detail screen**, both **UI** and **Integration**, which will show up when you click on a user in user list screen.

## Step 1 - UI
This screen should have the following information about the user
- [ ] name
- [ ] email
- [ ] role

**Tip**: It's a common practice to reuse some UI components of Detail screen in Create screen. So think if it's possible, in your app, to create the same UI for both detail and create user screen.
