With everything set up, it's coding time! (finally)

Your task now is to create a **Login Screen**.

**(Re-)Note:** because this is a new task, don't forget to open a new branch!

# Step 1 - Login screen

Your screen should have a form containing:

- **an email input** that:
  - validates email format
  - is required

- **a password input** that:
  - validates password: minimum of 7 characters, with at least one digit and one alphanumeric
  - is required

- **a submit button**

All the input validations should be triggered when the user taps the submit button, showing message errors accordingly.

You can use the following images as inspiration:

Once you've done, open a PR.

**Note:** These images are just inspiration! Don't worry too much about the design, just make things working for now.
