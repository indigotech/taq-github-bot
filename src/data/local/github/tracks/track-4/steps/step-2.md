# Step 2 - GraphQL
#### Estimated time: 2 hours

## Getting started
As we got our feet wet with REST, let's get started with GraphQL.

A little bit of context: [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a framework created by Facebook 🙀 that makes easier for create flexible and extensible server aplications. 

GraphQL can be a little scary at the first sight, but don't worry, you'll get used to it. Here are some tutorials to help you to get started with GraphQL:
- [GraphQL official page](https://graphql.org/learn)
- [How to GraphQL](https://www.howtographql.com/). We recommend, for now, to watch only the first 4 videos of this tutorial.


## Practice
As we do with REST, let's make a GraphQL request using a tool called **GraphiQL** (no code yet, hang in there). You don't need to download it, just access https://tq-template-server-sample.herokuapp.com/graphiql and you're good to go.

In GraphiQL, you'll have to make the **login mutation**. Fortunally, the GraphiQL contains the **documentation explorer** which shows how the queries and mutations should be used. 

The test user for this login mutation is:
```
user: admin@taqtile.com
pass: 1111
```
